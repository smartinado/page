        <h1>I built Tasmagic so the Tasmota community can onboard devices without friction.</h1>
        <p>
          Tasmota is a legendary open-source firmware with a huge community. Tasmagic is my take on a commercial-grade companion app: a fully
          offline Flutter experience that unifies discovery, provisioning, dashboards, Berry automation, and analytics. The downloadable build on
          this site is <strong>free forever</strong>—it is how I learn what the community needs while the Premium tier is polished for release soon.
